# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I and some friends decided to start the challenge. So I'm officially committing to #100DaysOfCode. Used today to gather book resources (not a fan of programming books but I'm positive this will change).

The books are:
* [Advanced Android App Architecture](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-android-app-architecture)

* [Android Apprentice (Third Edition)](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/android-apprentice)

* [Test-Driven Development Tutorial for Android: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7109-test-driven-development-tutorial-for-android-getting-started)

* [Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-kotlin)

* [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/)

* [Kotlin Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/kotlin-apprentice)

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/145-9352081-0973061?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0135957052&pd_rd_r=ae9d66ee-8b23-4dcb-9113-006da8ee698a&pd_rd_w=m7UQw&pd_rd_wg=LXGam&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ&psc=1&refRID=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ)

* [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/)

**Thoughts:** Kotlin is underrated(it's cross platform, compiles to Javascript for web and Native code for iOS) and I want to know it better.

**Link to work:** Got the books from [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org) and [Oceanofpdf](https://oceanofpdf.com).

N.B. : I believe people should pay for software/books they can afford. In the case of Open-Source, we should feel free to donate. 


### Day 1: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Started with [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), I guess the name suggested it and also the fact lots of android people recommend Head First Java. My IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate license expired recently so I had to switch to VS Code. Set up Kotlin to work on my terminal and installed the extensions.

**Thoughts:** Will print the 'bend your brain into submission' part of the book tomorrow and paste on my wall. Didn't do much, Procrastination got me today. The [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/
9781491996683/) looks promising, I am going to finish it in the fast and effective way.


### Day 2: July 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** IntelliJ is the recommended IDE by the book, had to renew my license thanks to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). While on Jetbrains, I remembered I signed up for [Jetbrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) earlier, checked and found out it's still free till January 2021 for me, sign up with [my link](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) and get free 3 months on the platform. Putting it to good use, it's an awesome interactive platform. Started this [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/) project.

**Thoughts:** I actually started the Academy when I signed up but I really didn't put any effort to it. I was in a hurry and was skipping some courses. Got posed some exercises and couldn't solve most, I realized I have to take a chill pill and get my hands dirty with code, literally.


### Day 3: July 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter one of [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), which is basically Getting Started: A Quick Dip. Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot Stage 3](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage3) exercise, the part of getting it to count from 0 to any inputted number got me.

**Thoughts:** The exercises are really engaging and brain tasking. Had to use my pen to 'solve' for the expected outputs on the Mixed Messages exercise. The making of the to count from 0 to any inputted number, made me think of possibilities.


### Day 4: July 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Studied Basic Types and Variables, Worked on [PharaseOMatic](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/PharaseOMatic), it's basically a function that creates three arrays of words, randomly picks one word from each, and then joins them together.

**Thoughts:** Apparently if data types are inferred on objects, e.g. var x : Int = 6, var z = x + 5. Due to the fact x has been assigned Data type of Int, z automatically copies the reference of it as an Int. Also I should be careful when doing conversions to not have spillovers, e.g. var x : Long = 2567875643233 var y = x.toInt().


### Day 5: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved most of the problems on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) that were concerned with the topics I've covered in [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/). Solved an 8kyu kata on Code Wars, had an issue though. It was working on my IDE but was failing Code Wars test. Got to find out, there was no need to request for input and it doesn't support the Scanner library. Finally completed Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage4) 

**Thoughts:** I think almost got myself worked out today, spent over 3 hours on my IDE. I feel exhausted a lot today, I guess I should reduce my pace a bit.


### Day 6: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the exercises at the end of Chapter 2. Basic types and variables: Being a Variable, finally done with the Chapter. You can see some of the exercises here [Hello Kotlin](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/tree/master/src/HeadFirst)

**Thoughts:** So far so good things have been smooth. The fact that I keep my pen and paper close by to solve challenges trill me. Is it just me or is that coding + music hits differently? Ohh I ran an infinite code, I used x =+ 1 rather than x += 1, I guess the count wasn't increasing so it kept on running and rerunning.


### Day 7: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter Three, Functions: Getting out of Main. Well so far, functions in Kotlin has been fun. Get it? Learnt about passing parameters or arguments also how return value works in function and also how to make the code shorter. Looked at for loop and ranges. Working on a simple Rock Paper Scissor game. The mixed messages in this Chapter is quite brain cracking, had to think like a compiler to determine how the code should run.

**Thoughts:** Today something funny happened. Plugged my laptop and was using it in the morning while it was charging, or do I thought. After hours of the generator being on and it finally got off, didn't take up to 5 minutes and I saw low battery warning. Checked the charging cable for what was wrong and found out the head plug wasn't plugged in well. 

**Non-coding Activity:** Well since I am already keeping a log of my coding progress, why can't I add spice to it? Well today I finally watched [Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald), it really wasn't amazing, just an average fantasy movie. Planned to watch anime and all but later decided to read the book, [The Rationale Male by Rollo Tomassi](https://www.amazon.com/Rational-Male-Rollo-Tomassi/dp/1492777862). It's been a good read so far, still in Chapter One of it though.  


### Day 8: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent today solving the [code block exercise](assets/dab.png) in the book. Compiler really does a lot underneath you know? Made this [Rock, Paper, Scissors] game (https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Game.kt) [Link to game gif](assets/game.gif) though. Finished up Chapter Three, Functions: Getting out of Main. 

**Thoughts:** It's all going fine, although the calculation could be frustrating. Had to calm down and carefully solve the problem. Apparently there are not many screen recorders that record in gifs fo Linux, so best bet is to record and convert with a gif converter. I got [Gifcurry](https://github.com/lettier/gifcurry) to convert my screen I recorded with [Kazam](https://itsfoss.com/kazam-screen-recorder/).

**Non-coding Activity:** Started [Black Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bullet), Rentaro the protagonist is badass though. It's actually an interesting anime. Oh, a course mate of mine came to visit, Dominion, it's been a while since I had someone over.


### Day 9: July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 4, Classes and Objects: A Bit of Class. Got better clarification of what happens behind the scene in objects. Looked at how to access properties and functions in classes. The [Code Magnet exercise](assets/drumkit.png) in this Chapter was a breeze [Link to answer](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/DrumKit.kt).

**Thoughts:** A function that’s defined inside a class is called a member function. It’s sometimes called a method. A constructor contains the code that’s needed to initialize an object, it runs when you instantiate an object. It’s used to define properties and initialize. An object is sometimes known as an instance of a particular class, so it's properties are sometimes called instance variables

**Non-coding Activity:** Finished [Black Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bullet), it was 13 episodes long. In my opinion, I'll rate it a 7.5/10, it has the amazing anime hope ingredient. We also see how the several characters deal with loss, and good character development. Watched [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(2018_film)) too, it was great. Who says you can't make a great movie with few casts?


### Day 10: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Now I know what lateinit really works, I've seen and used it in some Android projects. Also understood more on classes, the data classes I've used before are more clearer to me. Worked with getters and setters and why it's useful.

**Thoughts:** Initializer blocks are executed when the object is initialized, immediately after the constructor is called, and they’re prefixed with the init keyword. Taking it slowly to understand this Chapter more better.

**Non-coding Activity:** I honestly don't know how time flew past me, didn't get to do much. Started the movie [Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_(2019_film))


### Day 11: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 4, Classes and Objects: A Bit of Class. Did more [practical exercises](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Dogs.kt) on the topic. 

**Thoughts:** The pool puzzle on this exercise was tough for me. I've been advise to rarer used getters and setters so as not to run into compilation errors. 

**Non-coding Activity:** Finished [Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_(2019_film)), for was it's worth, I'll give it a 6.5/10. It's really not great but it's above average. Oh finally finished season one of the Manhwa [Solo Leveling](https://solo-leveling.fandom.com/wiki/Solo_Leveling), it was maaaaaadddddddd. Mehn, haven't enjoyed reading something like this in a long while. I won't spoil t for you but trust me, you will fall in love with it. Concidentally the second season was just announced a week ago. Started [Injustice 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice_2_(comics)), read [Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us_(comics)) a long time ago, enjoyed it too. 


### Day 12: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 5, Subclasses and Superclasses: Using Your Inheritance.  Looked at superclass and subclass. Didn't do much practical work due to the laptop issue I had.

**Thoughts:** A superclass contains common properties and functions that are inherited by one or more subclasses.A subclass can include extra properties and functions, and can override the things that it inherits.

**Non-coding Activity:** Actually today I had an issue with my Linux Mint OS. Ran into boot loop error(I've had it before), I had to get a USB Stick and used Gparted to increase my filesystem memory size.


### Day 13: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to effectively design an inheritance tree for classes. How to make a subclass inherit a superclass and how to tweak the functions in the superclass to be a bit different in the subclass. Solved some [Hyperskill problems](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914). 

**Thoughts:** When designing a class hierarchy, apply the *IS-A* test, which is simply, "Does it make sense to say type X IS-A type Y?" There is also a *HAS-A* test, "Does it make sense to say type X HAS-A Y?" 

**Non-coding Activity:** I watched [Hustlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustlers_(film)), it was enjoyable, enjoyed Jennifer Lopez's acting skills. Finished Season 2 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)) 


### Day 14: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 5, Subclasses and Superclasses: Using Your Inheritance. Inheritance looks tricky from outside but I guess with time I'll get better at it. Worked on [this](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Animals.kt).

**Thoughts:** Polymorphism is the ability to use any subtype object in place of it's supertype. As different subclasses can have different implementations of the same function, it allows each object to respond to function calls in the way that’s most appropriate for each object. The IS-A relationship works just one way.

**Non-coding Activity:** Binge watched Season 3 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)), didn't finish it though. Spent most of the time discussing, debating and arguing on Whatsapp.


### Day 15: July 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 6, Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Serious Polymorphism and as the name suggests, some of the terms used are serious. Taking it bit by bit. 

**Thoughts:** So if I don't want to make objects out of a class, the abstract keyword solves that. This is the part where the words appear as mumbo jumbo but with wore practical usage it will et clearer. I should spend more time in the day working on this though, these late night reading, I need more time.

**Non-coding Activity:** Continued watching  Season 3 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)) Whatsapp keeps taking me away from side activities. Reconnected with an old friend Iphey from 2017, conversations with her are cool. There's this girl I really really like, been asking her out since March. I've know her over 5 years now but the excuses she gives and all don too much. It's just the lord Future in me that's stopping me from being a Simp. I've decided to dead the feelings, I've lost my focus, time to regain it.


### Day 16: July 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at how to work with interfaces. Worked on some [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) questions. Learnt, "Roses are red, Violets are blue, Inherit from one, But implement two."

**Thoughts:** Well, fortunately there's a subtopic that handles when to make a class, subclass, an abstract class or an interface

**Non-coding Activity:** For the first time since I came back home. I pushed myself outside to go see someone. The experience wasn't funny, ended up trekking a long distance because I couldn't get a cab. There isn't much change with the world outside. Finally finished Season 3 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)). The season finale was great, the series is a solid one. Started watching [John Tucker Must Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tucker_Must_Die)


### Day 17: July 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through some of the curriculum topics in [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914), solved some problems. 

**Thoughts:** The problem of the day exercise was fun. A solution came to my mind and I decided to run it and it passed the test successfully.

**Non-coding Activity:** Played about four missions in [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_The_Phantom_Pain), approaching the completion of the main missions. Apparently today I was bombarded with lots of chores, ended up not too free at night.


### Day 18: July 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 6, Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Serious Polymorphism. The exercises made the whole interfaces, abstract classes etc. a bit more clearer. Worked on [my profile's readme](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/LifeofDan-EL), with the aid of [this tool](https://github.com/arturssmirnovs/github-profile-readme-generator).

**Thoughts:** Honestly most of the theory in this chapter are still hazy and all but I'll try to understand it better with time.

**Non-coding Activity:** Finally finished [Injustice 2 Comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice_2_(comics)) it was an amazing read, as usual from DC. Started [Doomsday Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_Clock_(comics)). I am thinking of starting workouts from tomorrow, I hae to keep fit.


### Day 19: August 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Actually didn't do much, didn't open my [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/) book. In my defence, today is Saturday and it's weekend. To not waste the day entirely, went through [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) and solved a few questions.

**Thoughts:** Saturdays are for chilling, it's weekend ni.

**Non-coding Activity:** Well today I started [Btoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btooom!), finished 9 episodes already. So I finished the Chapter one of [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_The_Phantom_Pain), which is 30 missions long. It unlocked the Chapter two.


### Day 20: August 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Headed over to [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914). Looked at Repeating blocks theory there, when I saw [this](assets/countPositive.png) problem and [this](assets/maximumElement.png), I was like, how would I do this? Told myself to try, found out it's just for me to calm down and actually think of possible solutions.

**Thoughts:** In as much as I would love to rush and start building amazing stuffs, I recall why I started this journey. To get my core basics very good, so far I've improving.

**Non-coding Activity:** Started my August fitness journey, it actually wasn't painful as it was when I started my April's version. So I guess my body is getting used to the exercise. Watched a movie, [Long Shot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Shot_(2019_film)) I haven't had so much laugh in a movie for a very long time. It's a solid 9/10 for me, enjoyed it totally. Done with [Btoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btooom!), apparently it was supposed to have a season two, judging from the ending. Played  [Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_V:_The_Phantom_Pain) a couple of hours.


### Day 21: August 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 7, Data Classes: Dealing with Data. Apparently, there's a superclass that all classes automatically inherit from called Any class. This, Any class defines several functions that are inherited by every class. Slept off so my update is a bit late.

**Thoughts:** I have previously worked with a data class in Android, had a little issue understanding how to structure it properly.

**Non-coding Activity:** Today was a bit hectic, wet out to assist my younger sister with stuff, ended up tired 


### Day 22: August 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still on data class, in it, how some functions work are overridden behind the scenes e.g. equals, hashCode and toString. Looked at destructuring of data objects and how == and === works in data classes. Today's problem of the day on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914), was to find the reverse of a [three digit number](assets/reversed3digit.png). 

**Thoughts:** I tried using listOf, ArrayOf and invoking the reversed(), asReversed() functions but no show. In the end Mathematics solved it, posted my solution and went to check other's solution. Saw a guy that made the int a string with toString(), reversed it then turned it back to an Int. One other guy solved it in a one liner, "fun main() = println(readLine()!!.reversed())". There are levels to this.

**Non-coding Activity:** Workout in the morning, my fitness journey is going well. Got a task my an uncle of mine, I have to help him type the movie script he wrote. It's actually not an easy work, didn't have time to do other stuff.



### Day 23: August 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished chapter 7, Data Classes: Dealing with Data. Apparently, it's recommended you declare the variables using val. If you want to make changes, just declare a new variable and use the copy() function. Made it halfway through the book, and I am happy about it.

**Thoughts:** AS usual, it's to understand the basics and get familiar with terms. The book is great.

**Non-coding Activity:** Spent today typing 16 scenes of the movie script. Finished the initial 26 scenes I got. Received the remaining 38 scenes and I have to deliver on friday. Today is a Wednesday.


### Day 24: August 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 8, Nulls and Exceptions: Safe and sound. Kt was designed with code-safety at heart, thus it has various ways to handle nullable types to prevent NullPointerException (experienced this in java at times). Enjoyed solving this [hyper skill problem](assets/divisblerange.png).

**Thoughts:** I am getting better at this logical solution of a thing. Hopefully when i start looking at data structures in kotlin, I won't feel intimated and scared.

**Non-coding Activity:** Worked out today, it was nice, i need my body toned abeg. Finally finished the movie script I was typing. Typed 38 scenes today, was faster because my sister was reading the script for me while I typed. Looking to go swimming tomorrow though, I miss it.


### Day 25: August 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looking as safe calls, learnt what '!', '?', '!!' and the not famous Elvis operator '?:' does. Also got to understand the general idea behind exception handling.

**Thoughts:** The pool puzzle exercise was a bit confusing for me.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read some chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)) didn't get to see it in the anime then, although they are plans to release one soon.


### Day 26: August 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I decided to take it slow since it's weekend, spent my time solving [Hyperskill problems](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) and looking at a few topics. Also was going through [awesome stuff repository](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).Made a [PR](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin/pull/573) to [Awesome Kotlin](https://github.com/KotlinBy/awesome-kotlin)

**Thoughts:** I am looking for some open source projects that are not mine to contribute to. Spoke with a friend and we are looking at porting a [particular project](https://github.com/dancrux/Med-Calculation-Kit) from java to kotlin.

**Non-coding Activity:** Relaxed, spent time on WhatsApp. Apparently movies don't appeal to me that much again, especially the horror genre. Took me a while before I started [SweetHeart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetheart_(2019_film)), personally it's a 6/10 for me, nothing great in it. Just an average movie with beautiful visuals.


### Day 27: August 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 8, Nulls and Exceptions: Safe and sound. Most stuff are clear some are a bit shaky in my head.

**Thoughts:** The Code Magnet here was a bit not clear to me. Apparently I don't full understand manipulating

**Non-coding Activity:** Went to church for the first time since this lockdown. I really missed all the people in the Gladiator's Teens Church. It was an amazing service. Read some chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), saw the Captain's Commander's, [Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Genry%C5%ABsai_Shigekuni_Yamamoto) [bankai](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Zanka_no_Tachi,_Nishi:_Zanjitsu_Gokui). Coordinated a zoom meeting as a gig today. Got paid too, which came as a surprise.


### Day 28: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Should have started Chapter 9 but got carried away by social media. Ended up just going through [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914), solved some questions which I was scared of one earlier. Made a [PR](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/tech-hubs/pull/71) to [Tech Hubs in Nigeria](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/tech-hubs/pull/71 )

**Thoughts:** Some challenges appear to be difficult but you just have to be calm and think of something to do.

**Non-coding Activity:** Should have continued Bleach but I didn't. Saw this mad flash deal on Aliexpress for the KZ ZSN Pro, looked at my account balance, got discouraged ended up window shopping online. Hopefully tomorrow I stay offline for a while and get to cover Bleach a good amount.


### Day 29: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finally started Chapter 8, Collections: Get Organized. Got  to see that there are 3 types of collections that gives more flexibility and control over how to store and manage groups objects. Basically List, Set and Map. I actually have been using list for a while, especially when I want to use a function and it's not allowed on the current object type. Got the docs link for the [Standard Kotlin Library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/). Since Arrays can't be stopped from updating and you can't change an array size(although you copy the original and make a new one but the size of the original array remains the same).

**Thoughts:** At times I press dot at the end of a variable and see what kind of function I an call unto it. Today I did something, typed return r[r.lastIndex] after I made r reference the toString of a variable. Found out later I can just call .last() to the .toString()

**Non-coding Activity:** Read lots chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), found out about [Ichigo_Kurosaki](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Ichigo_Kurosaki)'s [mother](https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Masaki_Kurosaki) and how he iis part Quincy and part Shinigami.


### Day 30: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** So I spent much of my time today on this [issue](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/issues/1385) on [Meshery](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery), through it I got to understand how best to resize an image in Markdown. ALso learnt about [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://beeware.org/contributing/how/dco/what/) signing before I made my [first pull](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/pull/1386) there to add the logos to the asset folders. Some fixes were requested and after working them out, made my [final pull](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/pull/1390). Also made my first Google Open Source Contribution to [dart site](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www), the issue was [this](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/issues/2572), made my [PR](https://github.com/dart-lang/site-www/pull/2573) and it got merged.

**Thoughts:** Contributing to Open Source projects is actually thrilling and all. Although I only got to work on docs but I have always been scared of contributing to huge projects. Will try my best to become better and get to contribute more.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read some chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), was supposed to go swimming today, had Ingressive4Good interview to become a campus ambassdor and potential lead. After the interview didn't have much time left, so I rescheduled to Friday.


### Day 31: August 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through [Jetbrains Academy- Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914), actually looking at problems that involve calculations with float and doubles and finding out how to calculate them accurately.

**Thoughts:** Apparently you could solve a calculation and proudly get wrong answer.

**Non-coding Activity:** I joined [Layer5 Community](https://github.com/layer5io/) today, got onboarded and I'm till going through the resources there. The PR I made concerning this [issue](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/issues/1385), actually inspired someone to join the community. 


### Day 32: August 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I missed out on today's own, due to some unforeseen circumstances I slept off suddenly at night and I wasn't able to do something earlier because I slept off.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts.

**Non-coding Activity:** I actually went swimming, haven't been in the water since March, so I went to LasMall resort center, their pool is like the biggest in Port-Harcourt.


### Day 33: August 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent quite a lot of time looking at different organizations that participated in [GSOC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2020. I can't be caught off guard next year again like this year. Spent a lot of time on Hyperskill too, trying to finish some topics and problems so I can catch up with the topics related to where I am in the book I have.

**Thoughts:** As i thought earlier, the earlier you get used to an organization the better it is for you to familiarize with their codebase and contribute effectively.

**Non-coding Activity:** Didn't do any non coding activity, spent over 10 hours on this labour, carefully searching the internet. Ohhhh, today is my father's birthday, a bigggg happy birthday to him.


### Day 34: August 16, 2020


**Today's Progress:** Still working on calculations using BigInteger,  getting a better grasp of it. 

**Thoughts:** My eyes are paining me, I should try as much as possible to give updates very early. Let me go to bed.

**Non-coding Activity:** Today was Sunday, went for service. Had provincial workers meeting, it was fun seeing everyone after so long. Watched to [Lego DC: Shazam!: Magic and Monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_DC:_Shazam!:_Magic_and_Monsters).


### Day 35 August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Continued on [Jetbrains Academy- Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914), got stuck on a problem which was to find the [L.C.M of two numbers](assets/lcm.png). Apparently when working with BigInteger, you can't work with normal 0. Found another way to go about it and I finished the module then took the module on String Templates.

**Thoughts:** Working with BigInteger is something else though, normal calculations don't really work due to type mismatch.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read some chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), didn't read much because I was mostly online. Did I get to let you know that I got accepted as the Lead for [Ingressive For Good](https://ingressive.org/) circle in my University? Well I did and I am so excited about it.


### Day 36 August 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at exceptions and taming exceptions. The [problem of the day](assets/digitsOrNot.png) was cool tho, solved a problem in 6 lines when I was seeing solutions with 15 lines and more. I feel proud.

**Thoughts:** Nothing much, there is this problem that works on my IDE but is failing online.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read few chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), the battles are just getting more epic.


### Day 37 August 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Handled Null Safety problems on [Jetbrains Academy- Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914). I had to trick the test to pass some because the problem explanation wasn't really clear.

**Thoughts:** So we kicked off invitations into our [Ingressive For Good](https://ingressive.org/) circle in my University.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read few chapters of [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)), I have been getting sleep during the day so I end up staying awake at night for long. Due to my eyes disturbing me lately due to the long hours on my screen, I decided to get an anti glare glass soon.


### Day 38 August 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at Type System on [Jetbrains Academy- Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914). I knew there was a supertype called Any but I found out today that there's a Nothing type too, which is like the last type below on the hierarchy. Got stuck on a problem, will have to sleep and try it again later.


**Thoughts:** I think my brain got overloaded, moreover I can't seem tto cut my late night habits.

**Non-coding Activity:** I finally [Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bleach_chapters_(424%E2%80%93686)) and it's easily the best arc in the whole Bleach manga. The fight scenes and techniques are something else. What a happy ending, Rukia and Renji ended up together, Ichigo and Inoue ended up together. Mehn, now I'm totally hyped for the anime adaptation next year. Got this extension for my browser [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) to help my eyesight.


### Day 39 August 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Tried the problem I got stuck on yesterday, no way, asked for pointers and was asked to use a try and catch. It worked, solved the remaining Type System problems. Tech Twitter didn't allow me to do much today. Worked on an [issue](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/issues/1435) for [Layer Community](https://layer5.io/).

**Thoughts:** I think I have an issue when writing the logic for the return part to actually work. I'll have to work more on that.

**Non-coding Activity:** Read some episodes of [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece), the fact that Kaido cut Orochi with one swing shows you how bad Pirate alliances are. Heard about the [whole gist](https://twitter.com/remiljw/status/1296918140132229120) of the matter and honestly I am dumbfounded. Why would someone be that exploitive of people?


### Day 40 August 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Looked at Arrays on Hyperskilll.

**Thoughts:** Nothing much.

**Non-coding Activity:** Spent long hours on errands.


### Day 41 August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finished up the remaining problems on Array. Officially done with the segment of Data Types and Variables on [Hyperskill]((https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914)), although I've looked into this some weeks back when I read it on [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/).


**Thoughts:** Today was weekend so I had to rest and spoil myself small.

**Non-coding Activity:** Played [Batman Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) for  a long time. Looking to start [Tower of God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_God).


### Day 42 August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Passed [this problem](assets/hasNext.png) I was running from for a while now and it's just 3 lines of code. Looked into Default Arguments under functions but most of the problems in this segment were not really clear. Spent more time than I should, currently failing a test for a problem and can't find out why yet.

**Thoughts:** I have gotten the hang of default arguments but the problems here are really not focusing on the theory.

**Non-coding Activity:** Finally opened my Twitter burner account, I finally can 'freely' rant. Played a bit of [Batman Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) and spent time on Whatsapp. I really should stop the habit of entering Whatsapp arguments on group chats. Started my Coursera course on [Inspiring and Motivating Individuals by University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/motivate-people-teams/home/welcome).


### Day 43 August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Looked at Named Arguments, the problems are still unclear just like the Default arguments.

**Thoughts:** I have a general idea of how Named Arguments works.

**Non-coding Activity:** An old friend visted, we talked a lot about stuff and watched [17Again]() together. Played a bit of [Batman Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) and almost at the final boss fight.


### Day 44 August 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Didn't do much, just looked at Strings Substrings. My sleeping cycle is messed up so at times I sleep off by just laying on the bed.

**Thoughts:** The substring is funny sha but very useful for some case study. I feel my solving problem skills are reducing though. This night coding isn't really working for me, I end up sleeping at times if I don't sleep within the day.

**Non-coding Activity:** Watched [A Bug's Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bug%27s_Life) and [Onward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onward_(film)), enjoyed both. Still spent time on Whatsapp, I am looking towards not going online for long. Most likely limiting it to 2 hours like I used to.


### Day 45 August 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Today I went through The Math Standard Library. Did little problems involving mathematics, I enjoyed it. Didn't pass the two problems I had earlier on, will keep trying till I know the fault.

**Thoughts:** Earlier on Kotlin had to entirely depend on Java's library but with time Kotlin launched it own.

**Non-coding Activity:** I finally went for Data Capture for my Driver's license and I got captured. Was issued a temporary one that lasts for two months or so. DC is everything abeg, I watched [Superman: Man of Tomorrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Man_of_Tomorrow) and it was awesome, I expected such from them. Also started [Spies in Disguise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spies_in_Disguise) but I haven't finish it yet. Watched few minutes of  my Coursera course [Inspiring and Motivating Individuals by University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/motivate-people-teams/home/welcome). Finished [Batman Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City) main story, the boss fight with Clayface was shabby.

### Day 46 August 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved the remaining problems under The Math Standard Library, then looked at External Resources. It's basically about how reading from other resources like Documentations, [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) helps you become a better developer.

**Thoughts:** [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) has been my saving grace. It literally the Bible for programmers.

**Non-coding Activity:** Fortunately or unfortunately I actually slept for long in the afternoon, I guess my body is trying to get back lost sleep. The anti-glare glasses I bought from [her](https://twitter.com/Cheedera1) came through today but I was sleeping and woke up to lots of missed calls. Luckily te dispatch rider dropped it off at a shop close-by.


### Day 47 August 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Didn't do anything, it was my big sister's birthday. Had to help out in running errands and also laid back and had mad fun.


### Day 48 August 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at using for loops. Found out how to iterate through Strings, Arrays etc. Also how to convert a String to an Array of Chars and back and use of split() function well.

**Thoughts:** Some stuffs aren't as hard as they seem, at times it's the question that's confusing.

**Non-coding Activity:** Watched four episodes of [Code:Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:Breaker).


### Day 49 August 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on problems involving String manipulation. You know that moment you hit a problem marked medium difficulty and to you it's hard? Met one again today. I'm stuck with finding a way to split the input into two equal parts.

**Thoughts:** Funny enough something just entered my mind now, why bother to check if the sum is equal if they can't be split into two first?

**Non-coding Activity:** Watched four episodes of [Code:Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:Breaker). Onyeka my cousin came over to spend little holiday with me. I slept quite too much today.


### Day 50 September 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** So it's like the forces of the universe are against me. Had a late-night online meeting and by the time I was through, I was pretty much tired and slept. I'm thinking of readjusting my schedule to do the challenge during afternoon hours. Only issue is the transformer in my area has been bad for over 3 months now.

**Thoughts:** None

**Non-coding Activity:** I finished [Code:Breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code:Breaker). It was worth the watch, Hitomi wasn't really a bad person, he just wanted the world to treat people with abilities better but he did so through bad methods. It was supposed to have a continuation but unfortunately none till now.


### Day 51 September 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Went through the Control Flow module, specifically the when statement. Solved the problems on it. I'm trying to solve [this problem](assets/luckynumber.png) and it seems like it's not working, will still keep trying though.

**Thoughts:** There are times it's as if your code is not yielding results, this is one of them. I got an email for a technical test for a boot camp I applied for, I will not continue it because their curriculum for android development is in java and I am not doing.

**Non-coding Activity:** I installed [Far Cry 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3) a while ago and played little today. Spent most of the time discussing online on Whatsapp, I'm slowly adjusting my schedule to avoid late night coding.

### Day 52 September 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** That problem is not 'medium' difficulty abeg, spent over 3 hours looking for a working solution. I tried various methods and thought processes, it was either I got errors or the result wasn't correct. Finally got a ['working' solution](assets/fsolu.png) but it failed some tests, till I got [this](assets/ssolu.png) shorter and better one.On a side note in my search for a suitable solution, I came across lots of codes and saw some nice things. Even got to use .slice for an array, used map too and saw other functions in action.

**Thoughts:** This problem made me start rethinking my life choices and I remembered that coding isn't a bed of rose.

**Non-coding Activity:** I went swimming my with Onyeka my boy and Favour my sister, it was fun. Met new people at the pool and actually had fun moments with them.


### Day 53 September 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Been solving problems since and decided to start one of [their projects](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Unit_Converter). Just started and didn't do much.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts. I'm very sleepy so I have to sleep.

**Non-coding Activity:** No extra activity.


### Day 54 September 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I pretty much relaxed myself this Saturday. Was suppose to continue the [Unit Converter project](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Unit_Converter) but lazied about. Looked at the concept of patterns, which is basically code design, design patterns and they sound like top level stuff, I'll get better at it though.

**Thoughts:** You would think you know something and boom, a new thing comes up and you feel like you are not capable.

**Non-coding Activity:** Spent most of the day trying to troubleshoot my cousin's laptop that got messed up from a windows update. Played [Far Cry 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3) for a long while as part of my relaxation.

### Day 55 September 6, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Got a reply to a hint I asked for a problem and used it to pass it. Finished External resources module. The [problem of the day](assets/sizeParts.png) was fun too, although I was reluctant to solve it as first.

**Thoughts:**  The makers of [Far Cry 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3) outdid themselves though.

**Non-coding Activity:** Today Erica of [Big Brother Naija](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0843319/), a reality show got evicted. I posted about it and some stuff on my status and got dragged, o boy how I do love some good bants. Candance Owen [served it hot](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/12600555/cardi-b-feuds-candace-owens-joe-biden-interview/) to Cardi B too, part of the reason I didn't do much.


### Day 56 September 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Just solved the [problem of the day](assets/simple.png). I got to know this can be solved in Python and Js in less than 4 lines with the use of eval function. Well, Kotlin supports [the function](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.js/eval.html) only on kotlin.js.

**Thoughts:** I am actually becoming better at this problem solving of a thing, me that used to fear algorithms.

**Non-coding Activity:** Didn't sleep throughout the night and had to go out in the morning on an errand. Ended up sleeping in the morning till 4. Had a call with my Co-Lead about our I4G UNN Circle monthly event.

### Day 57 September 8, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Tried out the new try-catch module under Exceptions that was published 11 days ago. I learnt you can put multiple catch blocks to handle several subtypes of Exceptions. It runs from top to bottom, so it's advisable to put the subtypes first before the general exception catch block.

**Thoughts:** It was pretty much a breeze, I am cool with Exceptions.

**Non-coding Activity:** Nothing much, just attended to my several other engagements, lots of stuff on my plates. I should stay off Whatsapp today though.


### Day 58 September 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked at Immutability, got to hear of the [Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) which I would take time to learn more about. Compared cases of when Mutable is needed or Immutable.

**Thoughts:** Nothing much.

**Non-coding Activity:** Helped my sister revamp her CV, started typing a new movie script. Was typing with my hands and got tired, tried using google voice typing, it works but not that accurate.


### Day 59 September 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Had paperwork to do so didn't do much, just solved the  problem of the day. Completed the module, Integer in Action .

**Thoughts:** No much challenge, just love how I am getting better at algorithms.

**Non-coding Activity:** Did window shopping on Amazon, I really want to get some stuff to make my room look more comfortable to me. Stuff like LED strip lights, Anime posters, especially workspace desk stuff etc. Finished the script I was typing. 

### Day 60 September 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Lol, how long as it been? I guess it's my two months anniversary. Looked at Data and Object Mapping. To be honest the whole concept is still not clear to me yet.

**Thoughts:** I am happy with the way I've improved.

**Non-coding Activity:** Did laundry with Onyeka today. Printed four copies of the Rumuije script I typed. Watched some episodes of [Daily Lives of Highschool Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Lives_of_High_School_Boys). Had a meeting call with few members of Developers' student club in my school. Planning I4G UNN event this month. Considering participating in black friday sales on Amazon this year, getting stuff for my workspace.


### Day 61 September 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Lately I decided to look at the Programming Essentials module of the Kotlin Developer Map on hyperskill. It's mostly focused on what actually happens behind the coding. Looked at Libraries today.

**Thoughts:** I've been using libraries and they are cool, looking forward to making one myself.

**Non-coding Activity:** Today was a Provincial program and I went to officiate. Left home in the morning and came back late in the evening. Almost done with, [Far Cry 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3) so Sam got killed by Hoyte, chaiii.


### Day 62 September 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Looked at Design Principles, which is the way to organize the code structure to achieve its primary goals. Got to learn about Design Principles like, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI), Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). They are quite funny acronyms to me.
 
**Thoughts:**  Saw SOLID design principles, looked liked one FANG level stuff.

**Non-coding Activity:** Completed [Far Cry 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3) today, played lots of the side missions but it's boring to me now, I guess I'll just uninstall. I really want to learn how to play NBA games.


### Day 63 September 14, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Looked Object-Relational Mapping(ORM). It is a concept of converting data from an object-oriented programming language to relational database representation and vice versa. It solves the problem of matching two different type systems together and synchronize the data flow between them. I've worked with Room before and it's an example of ORM.

**Thoughts:** ORM sounds like a huge deal but from what I did with Room it isn't that hard.

**Non-coding Activity:** Watched some episodes of [Daily Lives of Highschool Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Lives_of_High_School_Boys). I am actually looking for a way to drastically reduce my intake of the internet especially social media. I disabled notifications for my Whatsapp, will soon do so to other social media apps.


### Day 64 September 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Laziness and procrastination got a hold of me and I just did the [problem of the day](assets/strP.png). I really should work on my schedule. Peep my new IDE Material theme.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts, just sleepy.

**Non-coding Activity:** You know I've been hammering on reducing my Whatsapp and other social media consumption? Well today's own was much, in my defense I had a study to host by 8pm but it's a weak excuse. So I'll be looking at totally ignoring my Whatsapp and other social media apps and chatting for only an hour a day. Got a call from the post office to come and pick my package so I'll be going there to collect it, hopefully enter the market to pick one or two.

### Day 65 September 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Looked into the Single Responsibility Principle, which funny enough is what the S in SOLID acronyms stands or. It talks about you focusing on one thing at a time instead of dividing attention. For me, this is more productive.

**Thoughts:** None

**Non-coding Activity:** I had to run around for the errands, now most parts of Port Harcourt are congested, due to the various works undergoing construction.


### Day 66 September 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Remembered I didn't complete modules in the Control Flow section, finished the For Loop, which was giving me an headache before. Wrote some simple sweet code but ran into a problem in the While loop module. I am to take inputs and sum all the elements before 0, tried one way and it doesn't count the initial element. Tried another and it doesn't add the second element. I want to stick to using a while loop and not do a hack.

**Thoughts:**  I really ran into some crazy questions concerning for loops.

**Non-coding Activity:** I started on time so I was able to do much. Did laundry, been long since we saw good sunshine. I actually still spent time online, omo I don tire. Need to put that time towards watching stuff and reading too. I'll try to finish my challenges during the day so I can have free time at night.


### Day 67 September 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  

**Thoughts:** 

**Non-coding Activity:**
