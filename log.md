# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I and some friends decided to start the challenge. So I'm officially committing to #100DaysOfCode. Used today to gather book resources (not a fan of programming books but I'm positive this will change).

The books are:
* [Advanced Android App Architecture](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-android-app-architecture)

* [Android Apprentice (Third Edition)](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/android-apprentice)

* [Test-Driven Development Tutorial for Android: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7109-test-driven-development-tutorial-for-android-getting-started)

* [Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-kotlin)

* [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/)

* [Kotlin Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/kotlin-apprentice)

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/145-9352081-0973061?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0135957052&pd_rd_r=ae9d66ee-8b23-4dcb-9113-006da8ee698a&pd_rd_w=m7UQw&pd_rd_wg=LXGam&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ&psc=1&refRID=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ)

* [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/)

**Thoughts:** Kotlin is underrated(it's cross platform, compiles to Javascript for web and Native code for iOS) and I want to know it better.

**Link to work:** Got the books from [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org) and [Oceanofpdf](https://oceanofpdf.com).

N.B. : I believe people should pay for software/books they can afford. In the case of Open-Source, we should feel free to donate. 


### Day 1: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Started with [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), I guess the name suggested it and also the fact lots of android people recommend Head First Java. My IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate license expired recently so I had to switch to VS Code. Set up Kotlin to work on my terminal and installed the extensions.

**Thoughts:** Will print the 'bend your brain into submission' part of the book tomorrow and paste on my wall. Didn't do much, Procrastination got me today. The [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/) looks promising, I am going to finish it in the fast and effective way.


### Day 2: July 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** IntelliJ is the recommended IDE by the book, had to renew my license thanks to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). While on Jetbrains, I remembered I signed up for [Jetbrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) earlier, checked and found out it's still free till January 2021 for me, sign up with [my link](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) and get free 3 months on the platform. Putting it to good use, it's an awesome interactive platform. Started this [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/) project.

**Thoughts:** I actually started the Academy when I signed up but I really didn't put any effort to it. I was in a hurry and was skipping some courses. Got posed some exercises and couldn't solve most, I realized I have to take a chill pill and get my hands dirty with code, literally.


### Day 3: July 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter one of [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), which is basically Getting Started: A Quick Dip. Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot Stage 3](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage3) exercise, the part of getting it to count from 0 to any inputted number got me.

**Thoughts:** The exercises are really engaging and brain tasking. Had to use my pen to 'solve' for the expected outputs on the Mixed Messages exercise. The making of the to count from 0 to any inputted number, made me think of possibilities.


### Day 4: July 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Studied Basic Types and Variables, Worked on [PharaseOMatic](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/PharaseOMatic), it's basically a function that creates three arrays of words, randomly picks one word from each, and then joins them together.

**Thoughts:** Apparently if data types are inferred on objects, e.g. var x : Int = 6, var z = x + 5. Due to the fact x has been assigned Data type of Int, z automatically copies the reference of it as an Int. Also I should be careful when doing conversions to not have spillovers, e.g. var x : Long = 2567875643233 var y = x.toInt().


### Day 5: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved most of the problems on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) that were concerned with the topics I've covered in [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/). Solved an 8kyu kata on Code Wars, had an issue though. It was working on my IDE but was failing Code Wars test. Got to find out, there was no need to request for input and it doesn't support the Scanner library. Finally completed Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage4) 

**Thoughts:** I think almost got myself worked out today, spent over 3 hours on my IDE. I feel exhausted a lot today, I guess I should reduce my pace a bit.


### Day 6: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the exercises at the end of Chapter 2. Basic types and variables: Being a Variable, finally done with the Chapter. You can see some of the exercises here [Hello Kotlin](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/tree/master/src/HeadFirst)

**Thoughts:** So far so good things have been smooth. The fact that I keep my pen and paper close by to solve challenges trill me. Is it just me or is that coding + music hits differently? Ohh I ran an infinite code, I used x =+ 1 rather than x += 1, I guess the count wasn't increasing so it kept on running and rerunning.


### Day 7: July 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter Three, Functions: Getting out of Main. Well so far, functions in Kotlin has been fun. Get it? Learnt about passing parameters or arguments also how return value works in function and also how to make the code shorter. Looked at for loop and ranges. Working on a simple Rock Paper Scissor game. The mixed messages in this Chapter is quite brain cracking, had to think like a compiler to determine how the code should run.

**Thoughts:** Today something funny happened. Plugged my laptop and was using it in the morning while it was charging, or do I thought. After hours of the generator being on and it finally got off, didn't take up to 5 minutes and I saw low battery warning. Checked the charging cable for what was wrong and found out the head plug wasn't plugged in well. 

**Non-coding Activity:** Well since I am already keeping a log of my coding progress, why can't I add spice to it? Well today I finally watched [Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald), it really wasn't amazing, just an average fantasy movie. Planned to watch anime and all but later decided to read the book, [The Rationale Male by Rollo Tomassi](https://www.amazon.com/Rational-Male-Rollo-Tomassi/dp/1492777862). It's been a good read so far, still in Chapter One of it though.  


### Day 8: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent today solving the [code block exercise](assets/dab.png) in the book. Compiler really does a lot underneath you know? Made this [Rock, Paper, Scissors] game (https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Game.kt) [Link to game gif](assets/game.gif) though. Finished up Chapter Three, Functions: Getting out of Main. 

**Thoughts:** It's all going fine, although the calculation could be frustrating. Had to calm down and carefully solve the problem. Apparently there are not many screen recorders that record in gifs fo Linux, so best bet is to record and convert with a gif converter. I got [Gifcurry](https://github.com/lettier/gifcurry) to convert my screen I recorded with [Kazam](https://itsfoss.com/kazam-screen-recorder/).

**Non-coding Activity:** Started [Black Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bullet), Rentaro the protagonist is badass though. It's actually an interesting anime. Oh, a course mate of mine came to visit, Dominion, it's been a while since I had someone over.


### Day 9: July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 4, Classes and Objects: A Bit of Class. Got better clarification of what happens behind the scene in objects. Looked at how to access properties and functions in classes. The [Code Magnet exercise](assets/drumkit.png) in this Chapter was a breeze [Link to answer](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/DrumKit.kt).

**Thoughts:** A function that’s defined inside a class is called a member function. It’s sometimes called a method. A constructor contains the code that’s needed to initialize an object, it runs when you instantiate an object. It’s used to define properties and initialize. An object is sometimes known as an instance of a particular class, so it's properties are sometimes called instance variables

**Non-coding Activity:** Finished [Black Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bullet), it was 13 episodes long. In my opinion, I'll rate it a 7.5/10, it has the amazing anime hope ingredient. We also see how the several characters deal with loss, and good character development. Watched [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(2018_film)) too, it was great. Who says you can't make a great movie with few casts?


### Day 10: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Now I know what lateinit really works, I've seen and used it in some Android projects. Also understood more on classes, the data classes I've used before are more clearer to me. Worked with getters and setters and why it's useful.

**Thoughts:** Initializer blocks are executed when the object is initialized, immediately after the constructor is called, and they’re prefixed with the init keyword. Taking it slowly to understand this Chapter more better.

**Non-coding Activity:** I honestly don't know how time flew past me, didn't get to do much. Started the movie [Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_(2019_film))


### Day 11: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 4, Classes and Objects: A Bit of Class. Did more [practical exercises](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Dogs.kt) on the topic. 

**Thoughts:** The pool puzzle on this exercise was tough for me. I've been advise to rarer used getters and setters so as not to run into compilation errors. 

**Non-coding Activity:** Finished [Crawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_(2019_film)), for was it's worth, I'll give it a 6.5/10. It's really not great but it's above average. Oh finally finished season one of the Manhwa [Solo Leveling](https://solo-leveling.fandom.com/wiki/Solo_Leveling), it was maaaaaadddddddd. Mehn, haven't enjoyed reading something like this in a long while. I won't spoil t for you but trust me, you will fall in love with it. Concidentally the second season was just announced a week ago. Started [Injustice 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice_2_(comics)), read [Injustice: Gods Among Us (comics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice:_Gods_Among_Us_(comics)) a long time ago, enjoyed it too. 


### Day 12: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Chapter 5, Subclasses and Superclasses: Using Your Inheritance.  Looked at superclass and subclass. Didn't do much practical work due to the laptop issue I had.

**Thoughts:** A superclass contains common properties and functions that are inherited by one or more subclasses.A subclass can include extra properties and functions, and can override the things that it inherits.

**Non-coding Activity:** Actually today I had an issue with my Linux Mint OS. Ran into boot loop error(I've had it before), I had to get a USB Stick and used Gparted to increase my filesystem memory size.


### Day 13: July 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learnt how to effectively design an inheritance tree for classes. How to make a subclass inherit a superclass and how to tweak the functions in the superclass to be a bit different in the subclass. Solved some [Hyperskill problems](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914). 

**Thoughts:** When designing a class hierarchy, apply the *IS-A* test, which is simply, "Does it make sense to say type X IS-A type Y?" There is also a *HAS-A* test, "Does it make sense to say type X HAS-A Y?" 

**Non-coding Activity:** I watched [Hustlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustlers_(film)), it was enjoyable, enjoyed Jennifer Lopez's acting skills. Finished Season 2 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)) 


### Day 14: July 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter 5, Subclasses and Superclasses: Using Your Inheritance.Inheritance looks tricky from outside but I guess with time I'll get better at it. Worked on [this](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/blob/master/src/HeadFirst/Animals.kt).

**Thoughts:** Polymorphism is the ability to use any subtype object in place of it's supertype. As different subclasses can have different implementations of the same function, it allows each object to respond to function calls in the way that’s most appropriate for each object. The IS-A relationship works just one way.

**Non-coding Activity:** Binge watched Season 3 of [Castlevania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania_(TV_series)), didn't finish it though. Spent most of the time discussing, debating and arguing on Whatsapp.
