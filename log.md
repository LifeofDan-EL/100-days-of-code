# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: I and some friends decided to start the challenge. So I'm officially committing to #100DaysOfCode. Used today to gather book resources (not a fan of programming books but I'm positive this will change).

The books are:
* [Advanced Android App Architecture](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-android-app-architecture)

* [Android Apprentice (Third Edition)](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/android-apprentice)

* [Test-Driven Development Tutorial for Android: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7109-test-driven-development-tutorial-for-android-getting-started)

* [Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-kotlin)

* [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/)

* [Kotlin Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/kotlin-apprentice)

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/145-9352081-0973061?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0135957052&pd_rd_r=ae9d66ee-8b23-4dcb-9113-006da8ee698a&pd_rd_w=m7UQw&pd_rd_wg=LXGam&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ&psc=1&refRID=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ)

* [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/)

**Thoughts:** 
Kotlin is underrated(it's cross platform, compiles to Javascript for web and Native code for iOS) and I want to know it better.

**Link to work:** Got the books from [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org) and [Oceanofpdf](https://oceanofpdf.com).

N.B. : I believe people should pay for software/books they can afford. In the case of Open-Source, we should feel free to donate. 

### Day 1: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:  Started with [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), I guess the name suggested it and also the fact lots of android people recommend Head First Java. My IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate license expired recently so I had to switch to VS Code. Set up Kotlin to work on my terminal and installed the extensions.

**Thoughts:** Will print the 'bend your brain into submission' part of the book tomorrow and paste on my wall. Didn't do much, Procrastination got me today. The [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/) looks promising, I am going to finish it in the fast and effective way.
