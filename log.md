# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 13, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** I and some friends decided to start the challenge. So I'm officially committing to #100DaysOfCode. Used today to gather book resources (not a fan of programming books but I'm positive this will change).

The books are:
* [Advanced Android App Architecture](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-android-app-architecture)

* [Android Apprentice (Third Edition)](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/android-apprentice)

* [Test-Driven Development Tutorial for Android: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/7109-test-driven-development-tutorial-for-android-getting-started)

* [Data Structures & Algorithms in Kotlin](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/data-structures-and-algorithms-in-kotlin)

* [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/)

* [Kotlin Apprentice](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/kotlin-apprentice)

* [The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/145-9352081-0973061?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0135957052&pd_rd_r=ae9d66ee-8b23-4dcb-9113-006da8ee698a&pd_rd_w=m7UQw&pd_rd_wg=LXGam&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ&psc=1&refRID=P304582725WDEQW1PJAQ)

* [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/book/)

**Thoughts:** Kotlin is underrated(it's cross platform, compiles to Javascript for web and Native code for iOS) and I want to know it better.

**Link to work:** Got the books from [Z-Library](https://z-lib.org) and [Oceanofpdf](https://oceanofpdf.com).

N.B. : I believe people should pay for software/books they can afford. In the case of Open-Source, we should feel free to donate. 


### Day 1: July 14, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Started with [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), I guess the name suggested it and also the fact lots of android people recommend Head First Java. My IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate license expired recently so I had to switch to VS Code. Set up Kotlin to work on my terminal and installed the extensions.

**Thoughts:** Will print the 'bend your brain into submission' part of the book tomorrow and paste on my wall. Didn't do much, Procrastination got me today. The [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/) looks promising, I am going to finish it in the fast and effective way.


### Day 2: July 15, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** IntelliJ is the recommended IDE by the book, had to renew my license thanks to [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). While on Jetbrains, I remembered I signed up for [Jetbrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) earlier, checked and found out it's still free till January 2021 for me, sign up with [my link](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) and get free 3 months on the platform. Putting it to good use, it's an awesome interactive platform. Started this [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/) project.

**Thoughts:** I actually started the Academy when I signed up but I really didn't put any effort to it. I was in a hurry and was skipping some courses. Got posed some exercises and couldn't solve most, I realized I have to take a chill pill and get my hands dirty with code, literally.


### Day 3: July 16, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Finished Chapter one of [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/), which is basically Getting Started: A Quick Dip. Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot Stage 3](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage3) exercise, the part of getting it to count from 0 to any inputted number got me.

**Thoughts:** The exercises are really engaging and brain tasking. Had to use my pen to 'solve' for the expected outputs on the Mixed Messages exercise. The making of the to count from 0 to any inputted number, made me think of possibilities.


### Day 4: July 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress:** Studied Basic Types and Variables, Worked on [PharaseOMatic](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/PharaseOMatic), it's basically a function that creates three arrays of words, randomly picks one word from each, and then joins them together.

**Thoughts:** Apparently if data types are inferred on objects, e.g. var x : Int = 6, var z = x + 5. Due to the fact x has been assigned Data type of Int, z automatically copies the reference of it as an Int. Also I should be careful when doing conversions to not have spillovers, e.g. var x : Long = 2567875643233 var y = x.toInt().


### Day 5: July 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Solved most of the problems on [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/join/4db19914) that were concerned with the topics I've covered in [Head First Kotlin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/). Solved an 8kyu kata on Code Wars, had an issue though. It was working on my IDE but was failing Code Wars test. Got to find out, there was no need to request for input and it doesn't support the Scanner library. Finally completed Completed the [Simple_Chatty_Bot](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Simple_Chatty_Bot/tree/Stage4) 

**Thoughts:** I think almost got myself worked out today, spent over 3 hours on my IDE. I feel exhausted a lot today, I guess I should reduce my pace a bit.


### Day 6: July 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the exercises at the end of Chapter 2. Basic types and variables: Being a Variable, finally done with the Chapter. You can see some of the exercises here [Hello Kotlin](https://github.com/LifeofDan-EL/Hello_Kotlin/tree/master/src/HeadFirst)

**Thoughts:** So far so good things have been smooth. THe fact that I keep my pen and paper close by to solve challenges trill me. Is it just me or is that coding + music hits differently? Ohh I ran an infinite code, I used x =+ 1 rather than x += 1, I guess the count wasn't increasing so it kept on running and rerunning.
